# HMI Control System with STL Algorithms and Design Patterns

## Introduction

In this project, I explored several **STL algorithms** and **design patterns** to implement a modular, maintainable, and flexible **HMI (Human-Machine Interface)** system for managing control elements such as buttons and sliders. 

The project progressed in stages, starting with manipulating control states using STL algorithms, advancing to applying advanced STL operations, and finally implementing design patterns like **Singleton**, **Factory**, **Observer**, and **Strategy**.

Throughout these steps, I gained hands-on experience in both algorithmic problem-solving and architectural design, which are crucial for building real-world, scalable systems.

This document summarizes my key learnings, challenges encountered, and the strategies I used to overcome them across all tasks.

## Summary of Key Learnings

### **Task 1: Working with STL Algorithms**

In this task, I practiced common STL algorithms to manage control states in an HMI dashboard. The focus was on controlling visibility, enabling/disabling states, and performing operations on a collection of controls.

#### Key Takeaways:
- **STL Algorithms** like `std::for_each`, `std::find`, `std::count`, and `std::adjacent_find` are useful for iterating over, searching, and performing transformations on collections.
- **Lambdas** allowed for concise and expressive code, particularly for conditions and transformations.
- Algorithms like `std::count_if` and `std::find_if` helped with filtering controls based on conditions (e.g., finding all "disabled" controls).

### **Task 2: Advanced STL Operations**

This task involved using advanced STL algorithms to manipulate and transform control states, with a focus on batch updates and filtering operations.

#### Key Takeaways:
- Manipulating control states using `std::copy`, `std::fill`, `std::generate`, `std::transform`, and `std::replace` was instrumental in testing and transforming large sets of data efficiently.
- Filtering and grouping data with algorithms like `std::remove_if`, `std::partition`, and `std::reverse` enabled dynamic updates (e.g., hiding all sliders or reversing control order for debugging).
- Transformation of states and properties within the control list allowed for quick testing of different scenarios (e.g., rendering all sliders invisible or enabling disabled controls).

### **Task 3: Sorting, Searching, and Merging**

In this task, I focused on sorting and searching through collections of controls and merging two lists efficiently.

#### Key Takeaways:
- Sorting with `std::sort` and `std::stable_sort` helped me understand how to efficiently order data, with stable sorting ensuring relative ordering for controls with the same ID.
- Binary search using `std::lower_bound` and `std::upper_bound` provided efficient searching through sorted lists, ensuring fast lookups of controls by their IDs.
- Merging with `std::merge` and `std::inplace_merge` showed how to combine two sorted lists into a single one, an essential operation when dealing with multiple data sources.
- Set operations like `std::set_union` and `std::set_intersection` allowed for identifying common or unique controls, useful in scenarios like finding controls that are common between two HMI systems.

### **Task 4: Implementing Design Patterns in HMI**

This task integrated four design patterns (**Singleton**, **Factory**, **Observer**, and **Strategy**) to create a modular and flexible HMI system.

#### Key Takeaways:
- **Singleton Pattern** helped in managing a single instance of the HMI system, which maintains the current mode (Day/Night).
- **Factory Pattern** simplified the creation of controls (e.g., buttons, sliders), allowing new types of controls to be added easily.
- **Observer Pattern** enabled communication between the system state (e.g., mode changes) and the controls. Controls automatically adjusted their behavior when the system mode changed.
- **Strategy Pattern** allowed dynamic changes in rendering behavior (2D vs 3D) for controls without modifying their underlying structure.

## Challenges Faced

### 1. **Managing Complex Data Structures**
- **Issue**: The use of vectors and lists to store control states posed a challenge when performing complex manipulations like filtering, transforming, or sorting.
- **Solution**: Leveraged STL algorithms like `std::for_each`, `std::find_if`, and `std::transform` to manage collections efficiently while preserving the integrity of data.

### 2. **Combining Different Algorithms**
- **Issue**: Combining multiple STL algorithms (merging, filtering, sorting) was difficult when ensuring proper sequencing and conditional logic.
- **Solution**: Broke down operations into smaller steps and tested them individually. For instance, I ensured sorting worked first, followed by merging, and filtering.

### 3. **Design Pattern Integration**
- **Issue**: Integrating multiple design patterns while maintaining independence between them (e.g., how the Observer and Strategy patterns could work together).
- **Solution**: Adopted an iterative approach, first implementing each pattern in isolation, then progressively combining them. Ensured that each pattern had a clear responsibility.

### 4. **Dynamic Behavior of Controls**
- **Issue**: Ensuring that controls could switch behaviors dynamically (e.g., switching rendering strategies or responding to mode changes).
- **Solution**: Used the **Strategy pattern** to allow controls to change rendering strategies dynamically without altering core logic. The **Observer pattern** notified controls of mode changes, allowing them to react.

### 5. **Handling Mode Changes Across Controls**
- **Issue**: Ensuring that all controls (buttons, sliders) reacted appropriately to mode changes (e.g., Day/Night mode).
- **Solution**: Designed the **Observer pattern** so that each control type (e.g., `ButtonObserver`, `SliderObserver`) could independently adjust based on the mode.

## Solutions and Final Implementation

By adopting **STL algorithms** for managing control states, I was able to efficiently perform various transformations and updates on the system. 

The design patterns helped make the system **flexible** and **maintainable**:
- **Singleton** ensured a centralized, consistent control system.
- **Factory** allowed easy creation of new controls without modifying core logic.
- **Observer** enabled decoupled communication between the system and controls, allowing dynamic updates.
- **Strategy** provided flexible rendering options, letting the system adapt without changing control behavior directly.

## Conclusion

This project was a fantastic learning experience in both **STL algorithms** and **design patterns**. I learned how to write clean, maintainable, and efficient code, and how to apply design patterns to build a **modular** and **scalable** system.

### Key Takeaways:
- **Modularity** and **Separation of Concerns** are crucial for building flexible, maintainable systems.
- The **Observer** and **Strategy** patterns made it easier to handle dynamic behavior and system mode changes.
- The use of **STL algorithms** enabled efficient management of control states and transformations.

Despite facing challenges in integrating the patterns and managing dynamic behavior, I successfully built a flexible and scalable **HMI system** that can easily adapt to future requirements.
